name: "Get Weird"
brief: "Herbal Tea"
description: |
  Is a herbal tea that is used for individuals looking for something different & weird. Looking for a twist? We've mixed this tea with apple pieces, pineapple, pears, lavendar, and popcorn. It has a weird sweet yet salt-buttery taste that will have you wondering, why.
